## Brief Description
**HEMDAG** library:

- implements several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEM) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs);
- can be used to *reconcile* flat predictions by considering the topology of the ontology;
- provides biologically consistent predictions according to the hierarchical nature of the ontology classes;
- is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO). However **HEMDAG** can be also safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies (as FunCat), since trees are DAGs;
- scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples.
