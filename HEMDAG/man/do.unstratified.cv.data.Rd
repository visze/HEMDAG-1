\title{Unstratified cross-validation}
\usage{
do.unstratified.cv.data(S, kk = 5, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{matrix of the flat scores. It must be a named matrix, where rows are example (e.g. genes) and columns are classes/terms (e.g. HPO terms)}

\item{kk}{number of folds in which to split the dataset (\code{def. k=5})}

\item{seed}{seed for the random generator. If \code{NULL} (def.) no initialization is performed}
}
\value{
a list with \eqn{k=kk} components (folds). Each component of the list is a character vector contains the index of the examples, i.e. the 
index of the rows of the matrix S
}
\description{
This function splits a dataset in k-fold in an unstratified way (that is a fold may not have an equal amount of positive and 
negative examples). This function is used to perform k-fold cross-validation experiments in a hierarchical correction contest where 
splitting dataset in a stratified way is not needed.
}
\examples{
data(scores);
foldIndex <- do.unstratified.cv.data(S, kk=5, seed=23);
}
