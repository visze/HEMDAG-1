\title{Distances from leaves}
\usage{
distances.from.leaves(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{a graph of class \code{graphNEL}. It represents the hierarchy of the classes.}
}
\value{
a named vector. The names are the names of the nodes of the graph g, and their values represent the distance from the leaves.
A value equal to 0 is assigned to the leaves, 1 to nodes with distance 1 from a leaf and so on
}
\description{
This function returns the minimum distance of each node from one of the leaves of the graph
}
\examples{
data(graph);
dist.leaves <- distances.from.leaves(g);
}
